# hivery_challenge

The objective is to implement the layout.png and the funtionalities below:

- You can order the list by name, outlet number, market and author
- The list just shows the first ten registers, the remaining content needs to be displayed when you scroll down
- The list header must be fixed on the page
- Implement the search on the list
- It is NOT necessary to implement the login feature!!!!
 
All resources you need is located at designs folder.

To make it easier to you, We've already setup a python web project that returns the content to populate the list. However feel free to implement in the way you feel confident.

When you finish, please, send us the link from your github to be evaluated.

We need to be able to run your code through these steps:

1) git clone <your project>
2) cd <your project>
3) run command to install dependencies
4) run command to execute the application
- please use 'make run' to run

To simplify, you can consider that we have installed in our machine python, Node, Gulp

In the end, your solution must run in a Mac OS or Linux system.

Good luck!
